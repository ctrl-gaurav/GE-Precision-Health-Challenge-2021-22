<h1>❓ Problem Statement </h1>
<p>

Medical chatbots have a significant influence on medical culture. It has a higher level of dependability and is less susceptible to human mistake. People nowadays are more likely to be addicted to technology, yet they are unconcerned about their own health. They avoid seeking medical attention for minor concerns that might turn into a severe ailment in the future. This issue is fixed by the given solution. The concept is around developing a chatbot that is both free and available at all times of the day. The fact that the bot is inexpensive and can be accessible from anywhere. It eliminates the costs of contacting doctors. Given the scarcity of physicians, a medical chatbot that predicts a spectrum of illness based on the user's symptoms is required.  ​
